    <p>
      My name is Olga Serenchenko (soon to be Tanas...I still have to change my name to my husbands...oops). I was born in the
      Caucasus Region in Russia. My family moved to the United States in 2001 and I've lived in Arvada, Colorado most of
      my life. I received my BA in Geography-Environmental Sciences from the University of Colorado Denver with a minor in
      Sustainability and a GIS Certificate. Currently I work for The WhiteStar Corporation in Lakewood as a GIS Technician
      where I compile, edit, and provide nationwide land data. I am an aspiring full stack web developer and am in a partime
      Coding Bootcamp at the University of Denver.

      When I'm not working or going to class, I enjoy spending time with my husband and new husky puppy. I love outdoor activities
      like camping, hiking, and swimming. I enjoy cooking and searching for new, yummy recipes to try out. I also like volunteering
      in community events and being an active member of my church. My all time favorite activity, however, is travel. I've
      been lucky enough to visit Ukraine, Paris, Vienna, Vietnam, Tokyo, and Bali but plan on seeing much more of the world.
